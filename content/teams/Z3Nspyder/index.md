## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : AtmaNirbhar Bharat

_**Application-Type**_ :   Mobile Application

_**Idea-Description**_ :             BUTTON TO PRIVACY(B2p)

Wouldn't you like to keep certain parts of their lives private?? We do too, and therefore we introduce to you the button to privacy(B2p). The advent of smart communication devices such as smartphones reduces the ability of an user to protect their privacy and it's time to take it back.

Many apps play a vital role in stealing your privacy or may even lead to identity theft. A normal user will not take the time to review what permissions an app may ask before giving it access. A malicious app if given the permission to do so can access all your contacts, take photos of you, record you and also track you using GPS whenever it is commanded to.
About a month back, the government of India decided to ban a number of chinese made apps due to them being guilty of stealing data. One such app was Du Privacy. This app just had a simple function, display the list of apps using each of the permissions. Due to fear of data being stolen, an Indegenious app that protects the userâ€™s privacy is needed. We are proposing to build an indigenously developed privacy app that will do much more than Du Privacy to help protect your privacy at the app level. 

The prototype of the Button To Privacy app ensures that all your apps access only the required information and permissions for the app to function otherwise you will be alerted. The app is simple to use and you can easily protect your privacy with the simple push of a button. The app categorises the installed applications on the device into different categories with each category requiring only a specific set of permissions to function. If the app detects some unnecessary permission it flags the app and lets the user know that the app might not be safe to use. 

Once an app is flagged, the user can determine whether to whitelist and continue to use the app or can choose to delete it.

The unique feature of B2P is that it runs entirely from the user's side which makes it run quicker than server side applications. B2P is built on and for android devices. It extracts the category of the app from the Google Playstore and thus would work only on applications downloaded directly from the Google Playstore.


Conclusion :
	As privacy is the most important thing in this 21th century, our app provides complete protection to your personal data.You will get an awareness of the various permissions of the apps you install. B2P is very much user friendly and easy to use type with many customizable options. Currently it is a basic prototype but after this hackathon many interesting features will be added.

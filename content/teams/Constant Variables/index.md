## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Education

_**Application-Type**_ :   Website

_**Idea-Description**_ :    We believe that it's very difficult for students remember everything thats being taught to them and they generally tend to forget some topics after studying it once. Our tool uses text simmarization to provide concise and important notes to the students. Both the teachers and the students can upload their notes or textbook paragraphs and we will minimize upto 60% - 70% of it. We believe that practice is the key to success and that a student needs to practice a topic atleast 3-4 times depending on the difficulty of the topic before they fully grasp the concept. We provide students revision after regular intervals until they start getting better at that topic. We also help teachers schedule their curriculum, teachers can see how much syllabus is to be completed till when, they can see the performance of individual students and the overall performance of the class on our dashboard. The dashboard offered will help students get an overview of their progress.

_**Tech-Stack-Used**_ :  Html, css, bootstrap, materialise, python, flask

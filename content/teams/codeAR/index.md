Hey ! We are Team codeAR. We are Tech-savvy teens who believe education without contributing to the society is meaningless and in the quest of AtmaNirbhar Bharat initiative we wish to code, contribute and make India self-reliant.

## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ :  AtmaNirbhar Bharat

_**Application-Type**_ :   Mobile Application 

_**Idea-Description**_ :   The Scanner App will take images from the users device or camera and allow the user to crop, add scanner filters, genearte pdf file and allow sharing the file to other users using Whatsapp, email, hangouts, and other social medias. What differentiates this app from the rest of the similar apps available is that all off them are native apps and the native android apps use either external SDKs or readily available ScanLibrary for the entire functionality , but our App, will be built in Flutter and we will code the entire functionality portion ourselves.

We will also integarte QR Scanner and Barcode Scanner which will scan Barcodes of products and detect if the product is an Indian Product or not.
Furthermore, we plan to integrate on the fly image editing and text detection using OCR.

_**Tech-Stack-Used**_ :   The Mobile App will be built in Flutter Framework with Dart Language

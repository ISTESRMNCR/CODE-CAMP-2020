## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Empowering differently abled

_**Application-Type**_ :   Web Application

_**Idea-Description**_ :   Hello There , We are Team “The Coding Hush” .We are a humble team consisting 
                           of Richa Tripathi, Mansi Singh and Rutuja Narwade. The theme that we have come up
                           to after much brainstorming is “Empowering the Differently Abled”. Being differently
                           abled is a complex phenomenon which reflects an interaction between the features of
                           a person’s body and the features of the society in which he or she lives. To 
                           overcome this, the use of computer science should undertake a progressive path 
                           which we aim to achieve in this attempt of making their lives easier.
	                   The main ideology behind this project is to provide a helping hand to the
                           differently abled in a more conservative way. This is a web application named
                           “ASSISTIVE TOUCH” where we have created a room of solutions for people suffering
                           from various ailments of the physical as well as the mental kind. Following the 
                           logon, they can avail the comfort of sharing their grievances on a platform that’s
                           user friendly and open to all. Every candidate is given the privilege of creating 
                           their own user identity which is password protected and highly encrypted. The 
                           webpage is categorized in numerous ways for people who have lost their sense of
                           hearing, vision, motility, limbs as well for people who have emotional or 
                           psychological ailments.  The amenities that the web application provides include
                           information about the various helping centres, government schemes, opportunities 
                           for employment as well as special schooling, various informative articles, podcasts,
                           links for video playlists, a network for connecting them with people who share the
                           same grievances, calming music playlists and so on.
	                   The web application also provides a discussion forum that allows them to share their
                           thoughts and experiences as well as read others’ experiences as well. Their also 
                           exists a LiveChat and a HelpDesk section. A feedback section will also be provided 
                           for constructive criticism and for the betterment of the web application. They will 
                           also be able to contact us through the function made available.
	                   We might not have the experience or the pain they go through on a daily basis but 
                           we do understand it and hence, this web application is our way of empathizing with
                           them.

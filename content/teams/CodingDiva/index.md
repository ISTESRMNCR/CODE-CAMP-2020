_**Idea-Description**_ :  Smart note taker with text summarization: Online learning has posed a great challege to students, they usually find themselves cluttered with gathering resources from various sources but find it difficult to organise themselves, the approach would be in this direction, to create a web application to assign each user a special profile where he can maintain all his notes, The notes could be appropriately summarized and tagged according to custom categories, he would also be provided access to a discussion forum where he can connect with peers and exchange academic projects.

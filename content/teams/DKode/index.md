## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Education

_**Application-Type**_ :   Web Application 

_**Idea-Description**_ :   One-stop platform for all the study resources at one place. A collection and links to all the top-rated open sourced study material, YouTube lectures, personal and college wise notes and open doubt forum. The user can upload the best resource regarding a particular he/she has come across. No more crawling and surfing and wasting on the web to find the right and easy material to study. Most of the tier-3 colleges lack the quality of teaching and rely on self study.  This will be a platform to share knowledge and merge or make aware of all the great open source resources available. Platform will be categorised as per courses, branches, subjects according to particular fields. Users can upload pdfs, links, sources useful under that particular chapter/topic. The platform will take a limited number of uploads and will block the upload reaching a limit. Users can also comment down their views, and can provide extra useful tips for particular resources. The sources can be upvoted based on its usefulness under that topic. Based on quality and upvotes , students can refer to the best and most used source to study that topic. This community can discuss issues, and their doubts with the help of discussion forums. Also colleges can register themselves and create groups that will be converted to a forum to share their reference material of specific faculty with students , discuss doubts for internal exams . This college forum will be accessible to only students studying there. Downloading , sharing content will be also possible , this will help to enhance and spread knowledge. Study Buddy will be a free community where students can learn, share, develop and score together.

## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Eradicating Hunger

_**Application-Type**_ :   Web Application

_**Idea-Description**_ :   In the present scenario, there are various functions and restaurants where additional food made is either thrown into dustbins or some people even care to take them to the needy, but they are very few. Mainly people dont know how do they actually make the best use of food. We propose a supply chain based on blockchain which would include self-inspired people to contribute towards the hungry people by taking food from such functions and giving it to the needy. The application would include knowing of such ares where one might find needy people. They would upload the food and their location from where the delivery person would pick up food and transport it to the nearby place where there are needy ones. In order to motivate such people, both the donors and the ones who deliver it to the needy ones, offerings in terms of cryptoCurrency is provided as a reward. The application is totally crowd funded, though initially there would need investments from sections of the society. We even attempt to further develop a mobile application for the same.

_**Tech-Stack-Used**_ :   Languages: Solidity, JavaScript, Technology : Blockchain

## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Education

_**Application-Type**_ :   Website 

_**Idea-Description**_ :   Our idea is to provide an incentive for school children to study their lessons and for the teachers to be able to test & teach concepts in an innovative way in this lockdown. The lockdown has resulted in massive drops in student engagement, due to virtual classrooms. Teachers are not able to interact well, making the children feel the curriculum is boring. This has severely affected the rate of absorption of content taught, and student to not want to attend the online classes. 
We have come up with an online game, which helps students not only retain & learn what they are being taught in the class, but also encourages them to attend classes. We are targeting students from the grades 1st to 6th, as children in this age group love to play online games.

The concept of the game is to find words matching to a given clue word. There will be a set of words given, and the student will be given a clue word from the lesson taught. She/he has to find all the words related to the clue word. For example, with a history lesson, if the clue is Waterloo, the correct match will be Napoleon, 1853 and so on. The User Interface for this will be very interactive & responsive, and for every correct answer the students will receive points. There will also be a leader board where they can view scores of their classmates, making it fun, competitive & educational at the same time. 

We will also have automation software, which can generate pairs of clue words & matches from the content of the classes. This will be using concepts of Natural Language Processing, to parse text & provide the content for the game. So this will make our WebApp Game scalable to all subjects for our targeted grades.
This game will be providing a huge incentive for students to engage with the classroom, learn what their teachers are teaching, and can be used as a good measure of what the student has learnt from a class. Furthermore it will help teachers test their students in a fun way, while maintaining social distancing norms due to the current pandemic.

We believe our WebApp will help impart education, hampered by Covid-19, by arming schools with a unique teaching & testing methodology, specially crafted for making students interested in studying during this Crisis!

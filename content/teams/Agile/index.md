## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Eradicate Hunger

_**Idea-Description**_ :    Here comes the idea of our webapp which ensures that no food is wasted in the social parties,
                            weddings,homes,hotels and other organisation.Basically our web-app deals with the users or the 
                            volunteers who are left over with the food and want to donate it to the needy.The user can create
                            his food parcel and can apply for pick up.In a short time the admin will get request and will
                            intiate the pickup with their transportation collaborations.
                            We are not done yet!!
                            To encourage the engagement of the users or the volunteers, they will get points/coins according 
                            to the quantity of the parcel.These coins can be further redeemed in the form of coupons or other 
                            products that will be available in our online 'Bazzar'.Companies who want to launch or Advertise their product can request the admin to publish there product on 'Bazzar'.

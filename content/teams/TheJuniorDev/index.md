## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Eradicate Hunger

_**Application-Type**_ :  Website 

_**Idea-Description**_ :  Many charitable organizations are working to provide food to the needy. It is commonly observed that a lot of food gets wasted in functions, parties and on other occasions. Most of the hotels, also face the situation that at the end of the day, a lot of food remains unused and literally, gets wasted. This website is being created to provide a platform/place for all those who have the surplus and are willing to donate the food to ones who are in dire need of the same. Any individual, hotel, restaurant etc. (“Donor”) can register on this platform/website so that identity of the donor and the food item/s donated (item, quantity, etc.) is duly captured. 
List of beneficiary/recipient organizations will be prepared by taking the details from the office where non-governmental organizations (NGOs) get themselves registered (e.g., Registrar of Societies). To know the profile of beneficiary/recipient organizations and their interest in providing food to the needy as collected from donors, will be assessed. In this way, the final list of beneficiary/recipient organizations will be prepared. Beneficiary/recipient organizations will be notified about the donor organizations and food to be donated on continuous basis. Beneficiary/Recipient organizations can then contact the donor organizations and can make necessary arrangements to pick up the food parcels/items from the place of the donor. If Beneficiary/Recipient organizations work for people on the streets or for the people in the slums, then they can make those items available to those persons/people at their places. Donor organizations can identify specific beneficiary/recipient for serving them on continuous basis, based on their location. Alternatively, donor organizations can send a message to all the organizations through this platform/website. Beneficiary/Recipient organizations will get confirmation. 
This website will help those donor organizations who do not have the database/knowledge about people/NGOs to whom they can donate. This can be replicated across the country and can be customized for specific village/s, sub-urban areas, towns, and cities. In this way, it will deal with the issue of provision of the food from the organizations which have the surplus to those who need the same.

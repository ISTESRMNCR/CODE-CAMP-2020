Hey ! We are Team Unskilled Developers. We are here to compete.

## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : AtmaNirbhar Bharat

_**Application-Type**_ :   Mobile Application 

_**Idea-Description**_ :   Our aim is to provide a platform to people like local manufacturers and retailers to connect with each other and with customers. There are many local products of good quality available in India but they are not chosen by people because of less popularity. We are trying to provide in our app a feature to rate the products and thus helping the peers to choose better quality products. 

Because of this lockdown period and as stated by our Prime Minister we should use more local product as to make " AtmaNirbhar Bharat". We provide the medium to connect sellers with buyers. Any shop owner , manufacturer  can login to the app and can add their products. 

By this we tend to improve the supply chain management of these small businesses. And promote their business growth. 
People will get to know their business and ratings will help customers find good quality products and encourage manufacturers to increase their quality and thus helping in making our country AtmaNirbhar.

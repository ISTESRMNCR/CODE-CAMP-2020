## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Eradicating hunger

_**Application-Type**_ :    **Mobile Application** 

_**Idea-Description**_ : "We want a platform where different organisations, NGOs, or individuals could interact with volunteers for some social cause. For eg- Someone is free at home on weekend and is interested in doing some voluntary work, be it giving food packets, or beach clean-up, or just going an old age to spend time. And someone else is organizing it, so the organiser can put up all the information and find volunteers for that work.
This idea could work in real world as well as not everyone who wants to volunteer knows whom to contact or the vice versa. 
Like the retired people are free and want to spend their time. This way they can utilize their time and also be busy.
In this app, there will be two types of accounts for signing up- Individuals and organisation.For posting a notice, we will have two categories-
1.	Events- These will contain date, time, venue and other such details of collection drives and other such activities that are already planned.
2.	Issues- It might not be completely possible for individuals to organize and effectively address any issue they notice. So they can post a notice for the same, and request other organizations and volunteers to help in finding a solution. They details of how to go further can be decided in designated chatboxes and finally later on they can post an event for implementing the same."

_**Tech-Stack-Used**_ :    Java,XML,Dart,Flutter

## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Empowering Differently Abled

_**Application-Type**_ :   Web Application | Mobile Application (The Application should be hosted and Bundled)

_**Idea-Description**_ : Hello There , we are Team “Codeplay”.We have chosen to work on the theme "Empowering Differently Abled".Our main idea is to help those who are suffering from ADHD.   
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that can cause above-normal levels of hyperactive and impulsive behaviors. People with ADHD may also have trouble focusing their attention on a single task or sitting still for long periods of time. Both adults and children can have ADHD. 
Making a routine is important for people suffering from ADHD .Establish rituals around meals, homework, playtime, and bedtime. Simple daily tasks can provide essential structure. 
Our application consists of the follwing features:
Encourage exercise
Physical activity burns excess energy in healthy ways. It also helps them focus their attention on specific movements. This may decrease impulsivity. Exercise may also help to improve concentration, decrease the risk for depression and anxiety, and stimulate the brain in healthy ways. Many professional athletes have ADHD. Experts believe that athletics can help a child with ADHD find a constructive way to focus their passion, attention, and energy.

Regulate sleep patterns
Bedtime may be difficult for people suffering from ADHD. Lack of sleep exacerbates inattention, hyperactivity, and recklessness. Helping them get better sleep is important. To help them get better rest, eliminate stimulants like sugar and caffeine, and decrease television time. Establish a healthy, calming bedtime ritual.

Take breaks
 They will need to take breaks while studying. Break options like going for a walk, going to the gym, taking a relaxing bath
 
_**Tech-Stack-Used**_ :   Flutter,Firebase,Dart.

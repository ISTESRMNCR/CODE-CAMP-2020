## Project's Overview

_**Theme-Name**_ : Aatma-Nirbhar Bharat

_**Application-Type**_ :   Mobile Application (The Application should be hosted and Bundled)

_**Idea-Description**_ :   The restricted travel, panic over the risk of infection, continuous flow of negative news and scarcity of day-to-day material and resources due the corona pandemic are all adding to growing anxiety. Being confined to our homes can be mentally challenging. Besides staying connected to family and friends, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, there is also one other thing that can help keep anxiety and mental health in check - yoga. So we are planning to make a app on yoga where user will be going through a series asanas and kriyas. It will show user how to do the asana properly and time it.

_**Tech-Stack-Used**_ :   Java, Android Studio

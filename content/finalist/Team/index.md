# Description

> The description will go here and it should be Short and descriptive. (limit 150)
Our application will help connect volunteers with people who have similar interests and small NGOs and also can help with the problem of 
growing starvation-deaths and food wastage.
Our main purpose is make it easier for volunteers to choose how they want to help by listing all the events at one place so, that they can choose. 
Anyone who sees a problem somewhere near them and thinks that they can help, can put forward the issue in the app and can interested people can join 
or they can connect with the small NGOs too.  There is a chatbox for the same where anyone can communicate with anyone to discuss the issue and solution further
and also ping the one who raised the issue if you are interested to help."

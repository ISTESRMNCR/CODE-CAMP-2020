Team Introduction will go here.

Attention y'all, accept the greetings from team "The Coding Hush". The theme that we have come up to after much brainstorming is “Empowering The Differently Abled” .
Being differently abled is a complex phenomenon which reflects an interaction between the features of a person’s body and the features of the society in which he or she lives.
The main ideology behind this project is to provide a helping hand to the differently abled in a more conservative way. We might not have the experience or the pain they go 
through on a daily basis but we do understand it and hence , this web application is our way of empathizing with them.

Hey! We're just a bunch of sophomores aspiring to channel technology towards the empowerment of the world today. We seek to add value to the quality of life with simplistic yet creative innovations.

With _**Ruminate**_, in light of this pandemic, we seek to incentivize online education with fun assessments while creating an automation software to extract keywords from a text and aptly summarize lessons. We believe this idea could spark interest in students over virtual education too and hence go a long way in empowering the youth and the future.

# Description

> With education now making huge strides into virtual classrooms, capturing the interests of young minds is the next big challenge. Our platform puts together a fun assessment technique designed to keep students interested and alert.

> The assessments have been entirely automated using Natural Language Processing, thus greatly reducing burden on teachers (with little to no work on their part) while presenting to students a concise summary of lessons. The automation compartmentalizes a chapter into sections and brings to you a fun game based on these sectionalized keywords. The project seeks to inspire true learning amongst students as the student maps the keywords to the concept. 

> We also have a fun series of Vocabulary Builder Quizzes. This is the only aspect requiring input from the teacher; a list of words in JPEG/ PNG format.
We thus hope to help the student revise concepts comprehensively and aid learning.


# Why *Ruminate*?

* Automated assessment quizzes with automated extraction of keywords section-wise.
* Sectionized keywords help summarize and map concepts effectively.
* Fun assessment to incentivize learning. 
* Student mind-maps concepts enhancing learning.
* Weekly Vocab Lists - Fun Vocab builder quizzes.
* One-on-one communication with the admin for everyone via email



# What's next for *Ruminate*?

* A tracking methodology to keep a track of the weekly growth of students, and a leaderboard.
* Add to the fun with a multiplayer option, with weekly tournaments and teams pitted against each other. A team member provides his team with clues instead of the system doing so. This would further test their ability to map concepts while bringing in the extra fun of team games.
* Extend beyond ncert textbooks to any and all textbooks demanded by teachers.
* Host lecture videos as well.

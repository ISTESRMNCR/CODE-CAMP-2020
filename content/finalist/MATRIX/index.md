# Description

A number of good and quality products are produced all over India on a small-scale by many self-employed workers. These business though good are unable to attract customers outside their cities .Our main-objective is to spread awareness about these locally popular products by providing them a platform, i.e. our App ShopEasy and help them expand their customer-chain. We also aim to reach-out to all the business-startups, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our App ShopEasy is open for all the sellers and businesses. Users can Sign-In to the app by using the various methods we have provided, (Google, Facebook, phone-Number and Email. ) and add their products. Cash-on-delivery option is provided along-with a proper tracking-system. Options are provided where an admin can add product category and brands and customize the app in his way. We have tried to contribute to the atma-Nirbhar campaign by providing small-businesses a platform to expand their growth.

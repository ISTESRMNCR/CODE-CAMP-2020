# Description

> The description will go here and it should be Short and descriptive. (limit 150)
We want to create a platform where volunteers and organizers can interact freely. All the events happening will be listed at one place and the users can then choose to volunteer for any of them. With our app,we will be helping start-up NGO's and also can help with the problem of growing starvation-deaths and food wastage.
This app can be used by anyone wanting to help others ranging from the retired population or home-makers to college students looking to volunteer.
Features-
    • Two types of accounts for signing up-
        → Organization- For registered NGOs and corporate
        → Volunteer- For any individual.
    • For posting a notice, there will be two categories-
        → Events- Which have already been planned with the respective details of date time and venue.
        → Issues- Which need to be organised.

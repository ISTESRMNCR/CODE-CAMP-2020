Our team's main motive is to create a solution which can help people in this pandemic situation. As we are the children of this techno-era, we should give our best in contributing to help our people, through our skills. We haven't been much into the hackathon thing but, if we are getting a chance in this pandemic situation so why not take this chance and try making a small effort.

# Description

The name of our project is "Aprende Gratis", which stands for 'learn free'. Nowadays, considering the current pandemic situation the study and teach from home are in trend. Many different sites and applications are in trend to fulfill this requirement.

But the applications are quite complex to be handled by all. Therefore, we strive to make a platform free for all and which can be handled in an easy way. It will be a place where updating notes, videos and quizzes will be easy to be uploaded by teachers and much easier to be accessed by the students.

The student's and teacher's interaction would be much flexible. Moreover, the students can keep track of their marks, make their own notes and many such features are being included.

It requires a simple login/signup to use the platform at your own place. We are also trying our best to make the appearance as appealing as possible for the students.

We can epitomize that this platform would be much interactive and flexible for the online education.

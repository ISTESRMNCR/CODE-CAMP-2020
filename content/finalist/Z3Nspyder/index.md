# Description

> The prototype of the Button To Privacy app ensures that all your apps access only the required information and permissions for the app to function otherwise you will be alerted. The app is simple to use and you can easily protect your privacy with the simple push of a button. The app categorises the installed applications on the device into different categories with each category requiring only a specific set of permissions to function. If the app detects some unnecessary permission it flags the app and lets the user know that the app might not be safe to use.Once an app is flagged, the user can determine whether to whitelist and continue to use the app or can choose to delete it. B2P is built on and for android devices.

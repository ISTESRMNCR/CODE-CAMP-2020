# Description

People in india are largely unaware of the quality products produced and indeginously made all over the country, 
So they tend to buy majorly from international brands and only a few known indian brands.
Our Main motive is to spread awareness about brands which are loacally popular but are unable to attract cutomers out of ther locality.
Our website will dynamically advertise and at same time enable to increase their consumer chain.
We will be displaying Featured products from the registered stores on our landing page. We provide user verification
Along with that we will be broviding the contact details of various brands, It is upto the user to either proceed with us or contact
the store themselves. If the user is unable to visit the shop personally they can buy it through our online delievery facility.
Our website's theme itself portrays the fact that everything is available in india, be it out theme tooo. So lets Become vocal about local.

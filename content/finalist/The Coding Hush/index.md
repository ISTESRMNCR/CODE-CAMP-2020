Attention y'all, We are Team “The Coding Hush” . The theme that we have come up to after much brainstorming is “Empowering The Differently Abled” . Being differently abled is a complex phenomenon which reflects an interaction between the features of a person’s body and the features of the society in which he or she lives. We might not have the experience or the pain they go through on a daily basis but we do understand it and hence, this web application is our way of empathizing with them.

# Description
The main ideology behind this project is to provide a helping hand to the differently abled in a more conservative way. This is a web application named “ASSISTIVE TOUCH” where
we have created a room of solutions for people suffering from various ailments of the physical as well as the mental kind. Following the logon, they can avail the comfort of 
sharing their grievances on a platform that’s user friendly and open to all. Every candidate is given the privilege of creating their own user identity which is password 
protected and highly encrypted. The webpage is categorized in numerous ways for people who have lost their sense of hearing, vision, motility, limbs as well for people who have
emotional or psychological ailments. The amenities that the web application provides include information about the various helping centres, government schemes, opportunities 
for employment as well as special schooling, various informative articles, podcasts, links for video playlists, a network for connecting them with people who share the same 
grievances, calming music playlists and so on. The web application also provides a discussion forum that allows them to share their thoughts and experiences as well as read
others’ experiences as well. Their also exists a LiveChat and a HelpDesk section. A feedback section will also be provided for constructive criticism and for the betterment of
the web application. They will also be able to contact us through the function made available.

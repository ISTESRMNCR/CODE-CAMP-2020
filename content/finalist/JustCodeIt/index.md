# Description

 The restricted travel, panic over the risk of infection, continuous flow of negative news and scarcity of day-to-day material and resources due the corona pandemic are all adding to growing anxiety. Being confined to our homes can be mentally challenging. So we are planning to make a app on yoga where user will be going through a series asanas and kriyas. It will show user how to do the asana properly and time it and it will also help them
 connect with other people in our community section.

Basically our web-app deals with the users or the volunteers who are left over with the food and want to donate it to the needy.
REGISTER----->USER OR ADMIN 
USER-->
1)The user can create his food parcel and can apply for pick up. In a short time the admin will get request and will initiate the pickup.
2)The users or the volunteers, they will get points/coins according to the quantity of the parcel. These coins can be further redeemed in the form of coupons or other products that will be available in the online 'BAZAR'

ADMIN-->
1)The admin can add/delete the transport and bazzar products details.
2)The admin can initiate the pickup by selecting the added tranports and can manage it further.Also they can see the whole details of the parcel by clicking on its ID.

It was an amazing event, and we enjoyed a lot.

# Description

> The description will go here and it should be Short and descriptive. (limit 150)

Online school has made interactions between students and teachers much more difficult. We would like to improve not only the online learning experience but the learning experience in general. Our website is a platform where students can ask their academic doubts to their peers and teachers. Processes of uploading images of questions from publicly available past papers will be automated to increase efficiency. When students within themselves ask and answer questions, it drastically improves their understanding and bonding. We will have a point system for students who are actively answering doubts and have point systems for questions as well, so questions which are found to be generally difficult by many students are shared with everyone at regular intervals
